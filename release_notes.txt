    /playmidi command - opens a gui where you can select a midi file and play it.
    The player must be holding an instrument in the main hand.
    Only works single player or as the host of an open to LAN connection.
    Channels can be enabled/disabled individually. e.g. disable percussion track channel 10 or 9.
    MIDI note wrap to fit within the 24 note range available to the instruments.
    A transpose slider allows adjusting notes -12 to +12 semitones. I allows find the best setting
    needed to bring out the melody/bass. You can make many MIDI files sound pretty darn good.
    This command was added for producing a teaser video, but I thought some players might
    enjoy using it. https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/97z3nh/bard_mania_teaser/

    Add configuration options to allow disabling the gui button sound.
    I use this when making videos to eliminate those annoying clicks.

    Add a configuration option to append the client players IGN to
    the Minecraft window title. This is useful when using
    "Open Broadcaster Software" (OBS) and running multiple Minecraft
    clients using different player names in the dev environment or normal use.

Fixes:
    Stop running stuff from the ***Constructor***

    Tween sequences were not completing and leaving instances of
    themselves in the action update list and the tween count
    per ModelDummy was not returning to zero.

    This is related to:
    -- "Don't pass 'this' out of a constructor"
    -- http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=252

    Moving the start() out of the constructor solved the issue.
    I'll have to see if I can remove the Time-To-Live (TTL) since it
    appears the tween complete event is signaling isDone reliably now.
