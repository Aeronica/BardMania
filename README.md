# Play musical instruments and annoy your friends

This mod adds playable musical instruments that you can play from a computer keyboard and/or an attached MIDI keyboard.

This is currently in early development. It's my first attempt at using another mod authors library. In this case the
Obfuscate library by MrCrayFish. Obfuscate allows the positioning of the players arms, body, etc. It should also
be useful the rendering and positioning of the instruments in use and at rest.
